    Description: "The input() function pauses your program and waits 
    for the user to enter some text. Once Python receives the user's 
    input, it assigns that input to a variable to make it convenient 
    for you to work with."

"""

# "Add a space at the end of your prompts to separate the prompt 
# from the user's response and to make it clear to your user 
# where to enter their text."

message = input("Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: ")
print(message)
