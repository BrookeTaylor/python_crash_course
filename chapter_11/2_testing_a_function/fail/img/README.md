# Failed Test Results

> "There's a lot of information here because there's a lot you might need to know when a test fails. The first item of note in the output is a single F, which tells us that one test failed. We then see a section that focuses on FAILURES, because failed tests are usually the most important thing to focus on in a test run. Next we see that test_first_last_name() was the test function that failed. An angle bracket indicates the line of code that caused the test to fail. The E on the next line shows the actual error that caused the failure: a TypeError due to a missing required positional argument, *last*. The most important information is repeated in a shorter summary at the end, so when you're running many tests, you can get a quick sense of which tests failed and why."
