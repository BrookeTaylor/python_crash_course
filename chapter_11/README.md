# Chapter 11 Testing Your Code

> When you write a function or a class, you can also write test for that code. Testing proves that your code works as it's supposed to in response to all the kinds of input it's designed to receive. When you write tests, you can be confident that your code will work correctly as more people begin to use your programs. You'll also be able to test new code as you add it, to make sure your changes don't break your program's existing behavior. Every programmer makes mistakes, so every programmer must test their code often, to catch problems before users encounter them. 

> In this chapter, you'll learn to test your code using pytest. The pytest library is a collection of tools that will help you write your first tests quickly and simply, while supporting your tests as they grow in complexity along with your projects. Python doesn't include pytest by default, so you'll learn to install external libraries. Knowing how to install external libraries will make a wide variety of well-designed code available to you. These libraries will expand the kinds of projects you can work on immensely. 

> You'll learn to build a series of tests and check that each set of inputs results in the output you want. You'll see what a passing test looks like and what a failing test looks like, and you'll learn how a failing test can help you improve your code. You'll learn to test functions and classes, and you'll start to understand how many tests to write for a project.
