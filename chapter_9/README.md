# Classes

    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is one of the most effective approaches 
    to writing software. In object-oriented programming, you write classes 
    that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects 
    based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general 
    behavior that a whole category of objects can have. 

    Making an object from a class is called instantiation, and you work with 
    instances of a class. In this chapter you'll write classes and create 
    instances of those classes. You'll specify the kind of information that can
    be stored in instances, and you'll define actions that can be taken with 
    these instances. You'll also write classes that extend the functionality 
    of existing classes, so similar classes can share common functionality, 
    and you can do more with less code. You'll store your classes in modules 
    and import classes written by other programmers into your own program 
    files."
